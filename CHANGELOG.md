## [2.3.3] - 2018-04-19
### Changed
- The production package is now built with the TypeScript Compiler

## [2.3.2] - 2018-04-17
### Changed
- Use npm instead of Yarn in Travis

## [2.3.1] - 2018-04-17
### Changed
- Update packages
- Use npm instead of Yarn

## [2.3.0] â€“ 2018-04-07
### Changed
- Rename `backdropComponent` to `containerComponent`
- Styles are now passed as a styled-components theme to `modalComponent` and `containerComponent`
- The Container component now receives the `open` prop and should return either JSX with `children` (the modal) or `null` (when modal is closed). This allows for better customization like animating the closing of the modal. See Readme for example for a custom component.
### Removed
- Removed tests, as they didn't really do anything meaningful; Storybook working is good enough of a test

## [2.2.0] - 2018-04-05
### Added
- Add a secondary `_ref` prop for the optional `modalComponent`, so that you can pass references to more complex components. This is because `styled-components` eats the `innerRef` prop and doesn't pass it to its children.

## [2.1.2] - 2018-04-04
### Fixed
- `has-dom` workaround for tslint complaining

## [2.1.1] - 2018-04-04
### Fixed
- `has-dom` util correctly checks for `window`
- `<Modal />` runs opening side-effects on componentDidMount, if necessary

## [2.1.0] - 2018-04-03

### Changed

- `<Portal />` can be render to whatever dom element by supplying it in the `target` prop

## [1.1.0] - 2018-03-10
### Added
- Pass all other props supplied to `<Modal />` to the container component. This allow you to set `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`, for example
- When supplying an `appId` prop, that element is set to `aria-hidden="true"` when Modal is open
### Changed
- `modalComponent` and `backdropComponent` are set in `render()` so they can change dynamically
